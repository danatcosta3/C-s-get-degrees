    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Welcome to GermWatch! We are a team of four highly motivated computer science students with a drive for health safety.</p>
    <p>Upon arriving at college, we quickly noticed how fast illness was spread across campus. This led us to question if there was a way to check for illness and disease in our area.</p>
    <p>This curiosity is what sparked GermWatch, a webstite application where you can enter your city an index of sicknesses and diseases will be shown.
